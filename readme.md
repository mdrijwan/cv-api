#### Focus areas for learning

- Dependencies Injection
  + inheritance
    + always create interface first only then class

- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
  + extends and implements

- IOC (Inversion of Control)
  + polymorphism
  + interface

- TypeScript
- Unit Testing
  + mocha and chai

> Note: don't git rebase
